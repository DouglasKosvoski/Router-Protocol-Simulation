# Router Protocol Simulation

This program is a <b>Router protocol simulation</b> via network UDP sockets using <b>Distributed Bellman-Ford Algorithm</b> on a weighted bidirectional graph.


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to compile and run.
- [C compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:DouglasKosvoski/Router-Protocol-Simulation.git


Once the repository is downloaded, enter its main folder.

    cd Router-Protocol-Simulation/


## Running the program

Within the root folder of the project there is a bash executable called `router`. To run it simply

    # to run it, simply
    $ ./router <router_id>

    # or if it does not work, modify its mode with
